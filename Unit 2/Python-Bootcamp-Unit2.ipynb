    "This quick example covers the basics of importing functions included with Python out of the box, but in the following sections, we will discuss a few how to install (and update) additional packages as well as more nuanced ways of importing the functions we wish to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in math module is clearly useful, but a major part of working with Python involves installing and using package libraries from the web that contain useful functions that can aid in your work. The de-facto place to look for Python packages is the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/), which contains over 200,000 packages at time of writing in a searchable database. Moreover, conda provides its own set of curated packages in their official [repository](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo), and for more advanced users, [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) provides a community-led collection that is often more up-to-date (for more on conda-forge, see the [official guide](https://conda-forge.org/docs/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "For conducting analytics, a common package you may need to install is [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), which is a fundamental package for scientific computing (see the [official documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) for more details). To install and use NumPy, we can use one of the following commands in a shell (e.g., Command Prompt or Terminal):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pip:** `pip install numpy`\n",
    "- **conda:** `conda install numpy --y`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `--y` for conda is not technically necessary, but it ensures conda proceeds with the installation without waiting for the user to respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, these commands can be run directly in a Jupyter Notebook code cell rather than in a shell by adding a `!` symbol to the start of the command, lets Jupyter know we would like to run a shell command. In other words, the following code would work directly from within a code cell (you may try uncommenting one of the lines of code below, depending on your Python installation):"

  {
   "cell_type": "code",
   "execution_count": 43,
   "metadata": {},
   "outputs": [],
   "source": [
    "#!pip install numpy\n",
    "# or\n",
    "#!conda install numpy --y"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Assuming you uncomment the latter piece of code (i.e., `!conda install numpy --y`) and run it, this would tell Jupyter to install the NumPy package from the shell via conda. Depending on how your Python environment is set up (or if you are an advanced user), you may be better served by using one of the [IPython *magic commands*](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html) instead. These include `%pip` and `%conda`, respectively, depending on which package manager you are using (i.e., a `%` symbol in place of the `!`):"

    "#%conda install numpy --y"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Note that depending on whether or not you've installed NumPy previously, you'll either see some messages to indicate the installation went through or a message along the lines of \"All requested packages already installed\" or \"Requirement already satisfied\" to indicate the package was installed previously. Be aware that the command can occasionally take quite a bit of time to show an actual output, and in the meantime, the code cell may show a `[*]` to the left of the cell to indicate it's working on processing your request.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Updating Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides installing NumPy, you may also want to consider upgrading it from time to time. New versions of packages may contain important fixes, features, or performance improvements that could make your work easier or faster. Alternatively, updates may also break some of your existing code (requiring you to update it), so it's not always a good idea to update every time a new version of a package is released.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, to update out-of-date packages, you can use one of the following commands (with NumPy being used as an example here):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pip:** `pip install numpy --upgrade`\n",
    "- **conda:** `conda update numpy --y`"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Again, you can combine these commands with either a `!` or `%` to run them directly from Jupyter rather than running them from the shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, you can see if any of your packages are out of date and upgrade them using conda via the following syntax: `conda update --all`. Similarly, for pip you can use `!pip list -o` to see outdated packages or you can use the handy [pip-review](https://github.com/jgonggrijp/pip-review) wrapper to help with upgrading everything (to install pip-review from PyPI use `!pip install pip-review` first). Again, how you perform the actual upgrade process depends on your package manager (e.g., pip vs. conda).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it's worth noting that both conda and pip support many additional commands that can be useful from time. For instance, assuming you had a reason to remove a package, you could do so using a command such as `!conda remove ...` or `!pip uninstall ...` (where `...` represents one or more space-separated package names you wish to remove). For a convenient list of commands that shows both conda and pip, see the following [guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands.html#conda-vs-pip-vs-virtualenv-commands).\n",
